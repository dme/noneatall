Whilst thinking about web interfaces for notmuch I decided that it would
be quicker to implement one and play rather than trying to consider all
possibilities. The result is noneatall.

It's _very_ simple and pretty nasty. Please look at the source before
you use it - there are no doubt a variety of security holes.

Feel free to use, enhance, etc. It would be good if improvements were
made available to all.
